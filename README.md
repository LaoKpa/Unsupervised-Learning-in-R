# Unsupervised Learning in R

Unsupervised machine learning is a class of algorithms that identifies patterns
in unlabeled data, i.e. without considering an outcome or target. This workshop
will describe and demonstrate powerful unsupervised learning algorithms used for
clustering (hdbscan, latent class analysis, hopach), dimensionality
reduction (generalized low-rank models), visualization (umap), and anomaly detection (isolation forests).
Participants will learn how to structure unsupervised
learning analyses and will gain familiarity with example code that can be
adapted to their own projects.

## Prerequisites

This is an intermediate machine learning workshop. Participants should have
significant prior experience with R and RStudio, including manipulation of data
frames, installation of packages, and plotting.

**Prerequisite workshops**

 * [R Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals)
 
**Recommended workshops**

 * [Machine Learning in R](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Machine-Learning-in-R)

## Technology requirements

Participants should have access to a computer with the following software:

 * R version 3.6 or greater
 * RStudio
 
## Initial steps for participants

To prepare for the workshop, please download the materials and work through the package installation in `0-setup.Rmd`. Please report any errors to the [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Unsupervised-Learning-in-R/issues).
