## Highlights

* UMAP is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm intended for data visualization.
* It seeks to capture local distances (nearby points stay together) rather than global distances (all points transformed in the same way, as in principal component analysis).
* It is inspired by **t-SNE** but arguably is preferable due to favorable properties: more scalable performance and better capture of local structure.
* It originates from topology, and discovers **manifolds**: nonlinear surfaces that connect nearby points.

## Key assumptions

* All data are locally connected. That is, the data distribution can be approximately by smoothing between observations with similar covariate profiles.

## Data prep

We're trying out a separate birth weight dataset.

```{r data_prep}
data = MASS::birthwt
summary(data)
?MASS::birthwt
data$race = factor(data$race, labels = c("white", "black", "other"))
str(data)

# Create a list to hold different variables.
task = list(
  # Birth weight or low are generally our outcomes for supervised analyses.
  outcomes = c("bwt", "low"),
  
  # Variables we want to exclude from our analysis - none currently.
  exclude = NULL
)

task$covariates = setdiff(names(data), task$outcomes)

# Review our data structure.
task

dplyr::glimpse(data[task$covariates])
sapply(data[task$covariates], class)


# Convert factor to indicators - don't run on outcomes though.
result = ck37r::factors_to_indicators(data, predictors = task$covariates, verbose = TRUE)
data = result$data
```

## Basic UMAP

```{r basic_umap}
library(umap)

# Conduct UMAP analysis of our matrix data, setting a random seed.
result = umap(data, random_state = 1)
```

## Plot UMAP

```{r umap_plot}
library(ggplot2)

# Compile results into a dataframe.
plot_data = data.frame(x = result$layout[, 1],
                       y = result$layout[, 2],
                       data[, task$outcomes])

# Create an initial plot object.
p = ggplot(data = plot_data, aes(x = x, y = y, color = bwt)) +
  theme_minimal()

p + geom_point() + ggtitle("Continuous birth weight")

# Compare to the binarized outcome.
p + geom_point(aes(color = low)) + ggtitle("Low birth weight = 1")
```

## Hyperparameters

```{r}
# Review default settings.
umap.defaults

config = umap.defaults

# Set a seed.
config$random_state = 1
config$n_neighbors = 30

# Run umap with new settings.
result2 = umap(data, config)

p + geom_point(aes(x = result2$layout[, 1],
                   y = result2$layout[, 2]))

# Try even more neighbors.
config$n_neighbors = 60

result3 = umap(data, config)

p + geom_point(aes(x = result3$layout[, 1],
                   y = result3$layout[, 2]))
```

## Additional hyperparameters

Noting a few other highlights:

* **n_components** - dimensions to return, typically 2 but can be larger.
* **metric** - distance metric, such as euclidean, manhattan, cosine, etc.
* **n_epochs** - number of optimization iterations to perform, default 200.

```{r}
# Review the many other hyperparameters.
umap.defaults
help(umap.defaults)
```

Also note that when calling umap, the function argument `method` can be changed to "umap-learn" to use the python package.

More info on hyperparameters on the [umap-learn python documentation page](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters.html).

```{r}
?umap
```

## Challenge

* Try out on heart dataset
